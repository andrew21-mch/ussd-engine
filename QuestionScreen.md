# QuestionScreen

In order to separate concerns between asnwering or choosing a option and interacting and navigating through the content of a question, we created the Question Screen. Which basically is a Botman Question wrapping our FieldQuestions. This allow us to pass the question screens to the botman bot, as questions, and handle all user interactions for the question in context.


The question screen takes all the text pieces from the FieldQuestion and paginate them, adding navigation options also.
